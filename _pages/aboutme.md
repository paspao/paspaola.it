My name is Pasquale Paola and I love the Information Technology. I am a developer, an architect, a designer, a lot of titles was assigned to me along my life, I don't know what is the main title, but I know that I love new tecnoglies and software in every shape (I know it seems very boring :-D). My main activity is Software Architecture and Skeleton Design based on cloud or on-premise system. I don't have a preferred tecnology.

I read a lot to get a deep understanding. In the last years i worked on modern environments like AWS, Heroku, GCP, Azure. 

This is a blog where I want share my experiences in my work, but also in my life (a dev life :-D)...ok this is my main passion but I have a lot of passions :-D :-D :-D

Sport helps me to cut off from every problems in my work. The main goal of every worker, in IT context, it's *problem solving*. If you help your mind with sports and entertainments, a lot of these problems will be solved, for sure.
